You have just created a new build profile named <%= name %>.

The next step is to edit this file so that it loads all of the dependencies that your
application requires.  For more information on how to set this up, then review the
information at:

  http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-4-meta-dojo/package-system-and-custom-builds

After you have edited the build profile, you can generate a build.  To create a dojo build
that includes your custom profile, then run this rake task from the root directory of your
rails app:

rake drails:build:do

Running this command will create the release directory (it contains a lot of files):

public/javascripts/dojo/release

The release directory contains the pre-built files that you create by running the rake task:

public/javascripts/dojo/release/dojo/dojo.js
public/javascripts/dojo/release/dojo/dojo.uncompressed.js
public/javascripts/dojo/release/dojo/<%= name %>.js
public/javascripts/dojo/release/dojo/<%= name %>.uncompressed.js

The uncompressed files are great for debugging in development, but it's best to include
only the compressed files for your production application.  If your application does
not require any other dependencies at runtime, then these are the only files that you need
for your application and all other files can be safely deleted from the release directory.
Ideally, your production build includes all dependencies and does not require any other
dependencies included at runtime.

To use the pre-built files in your application, just edit your layout or view
so that it includes the following code:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/dojo/release/dojo/dojo/dojo.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/dojo/release/dojo/dojo/<%= name %>.js"></script>

That should be all you need to start using your custom build!
