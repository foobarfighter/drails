drails
=======

drails allows you to use RJS with Dojo in your Rails application.  It completely replaces the need
for Prototype/Scriptaculous in your application and let's you use the powerful Dojo Toolkit as
your Javascript library.

Examples:
=========
The best way to see how to use drails helpers is to view the specs.  Most people will be interested in
prototype_helper_spec.rb and scriptaculous_helper_spec.rb.  For a quick taste, here is an example of how
you can create an link that replaces the "success_response" div on successful completion of an ajax call
with the HTML returned by the server:

<%=
  link_to_remote "my link", :update => [ :success => "_response" ], :url => { :action => "myaction" }
%>
<div id="success_response">...some html to be replaced...</div>


To see the usages for the drails generators for dojo modules, dijits, and build profiles, type this
from the command line:

cd my_rails_app; script/generate dojo

drails comes with some handy rake tasks for incorporating dojo builds.  To see what is available, type
this from the command line.

cd my_rails_app; rake -T | grep drails

Installation:
=============
# drails relies on the dojo-pkg gem.  Installing this gem can sometimes take a while
gem install dojo-pkg
cd my_rails_app
script/plugin install git://github.com/foobarfighter/drails.git

** NOTE: This also installs the dojo-pkg gem (a package that includes the dojo source code) from rubyforge.
This can sometimes take a while.

How it works:
=============
drails tries not to touch Rails' ruby internals as much as possible by providing a client
side library that provides the same argument interface as Prototype/Scriptaculous.  The method
names and objects map to the Prototype/Scriptaculous methods and objects needed for emulating the
RJS helper APIs as well as help with any argument munging that is needed due to inconsistencies
between the Dojo and Prototype/Scriptaculous APIs.

drails overrides Rails' ruby internals only when it needs to in order to call out to drails functions
instead of Prototype/Scriptaculous.  This monkey patching is necessary only because Rails/RJS is so
tightly coupled to the Javascript framework that is bundled with it.

Limitations:
============
- drails supports all of the most common Rails helpers, but does not fully support RJS.  If there is
  a huge demand for this, then I will add the complete RJS implementation, but I'm assuming that most
  people that are using Dojo, prefer to right Javascript instead of Ruby generated Javascript.
