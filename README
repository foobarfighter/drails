d-rails
=======

d-rails allows you to use RJS with Dojo in your Rails application.  It completely replaces the need
for Prototype/Scriptaculous in your application and let's you use the more powerful Dojo Toolkit as
your Javascript library.

How it works:
=============
d-rails tries not to touch Rails' ruby internals as much as possible by providing a client
side library that provides the same argument interface as Prototype/Scriptaculous.  The method
names and objects map to the Prototype/Scriptaculous methods and objects needed for emulating the
RJS helper APIs as well as help with any argument munging that is needed due to inconsistencies
between the Dojo and Prototype/Scriptaculous APIs.

d-rails overrides Rails' ruby internals only when it needs to in order to call out to d-rails functions
instead of Prototype/Scriptaculous.  This monkey patching is necessary only because Rails/RJS is so
tightly coupled to the Javascript framework that is bundled with it.
